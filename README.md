# PRODIGY_WD_03 - Contact Management System

This repository contains the third task of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech** under the **Web Development Track**.

## 🚀 Task Objective

Develop a GUI-based Contact Management System using C++ and the Win32 API that allows users to:

- Add a new contact (Name, Phone Number, Email Address)
- View all saved contacts
- Edit an existing contact
- Delete a contact
- Save contacts persistently in a file

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implementation of GUI using Win32 API in C++

- Modular coding practices for better readability and maintenance
- Handling user input and validation in GUI applications
- Structuring data and managing dynamic memory

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Language: C++
- Framework: Win32 API
- IDE: Visual Studio
- File Format: `.txt` or `.csv` for data persistence
